# Bridge Walks Calculator

# Overview
This Bridge Walks Calculator is a Python-based tool designed to compute all possible walks across a set of bridges connecting various areas. It is particularly useful for scenarios where bridges connect different points (like islands or cities) and you want to find all the unique paths that can be taken by starting from a specific point and crossing each bridge only once.

# Files in the Project
The project consists of three primary Python files:

 possiblewalks.py: Contains the core logic for generating walks from a given starting point.
 areas.py: Utilizes possiblewalks.py to generate walks starting from multiple predefined areas.
 allwalks.py: Aggregates all the walks and filters them based on specific criteria, such as length of the walk.

# How It Works

# Generating Walks:

The get_walks_starting_from function in possiblewalks.py is used to generate all possible walks starting from a given area.
This function uses recursion to explore all paths across bridges, ensuring each bridge is crossed only once in a walk.

# Calculating Walks from Multiple Areas:

areas.py uses get_walks_starting_from to calculate walks starting from each of the specified areas (like 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D').

# Aggregating and Filtering Walks:

allwalks.py combines all walks from different starting points and filters them based on specific criteria (e.g., walks of a certain length).
Usage
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Place all three files (possiblewalks.py, areas.py, allwalks.py) in the same directory.
Run areas.py to generate walks from multiple areas.
Run allwalks.py to aggregate and filter these walks according to your needs.

# Example Output
# Total number of walks starting from each area.
Number of walks of a specific length (e.g., 15) from all starting points.

# Requirements
Python 3.x

# Conclusion
Our project, the Bridge Walks Calculator, was developed to explore the possibilities of crossing a network of bridges without crossing the same bridge more than once. After extensive calculation and analysis using our Python-based tool, we have reached a significant conclusion: it is impossible to cross all the bridges exactly once without repeating any bridge.

This outcome aligns with the famous "Bridges of Königsberg" problem in graph theory. In this historical problem, the city of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) was divided by the Pregel River and connected by seven bridges. The challenge was to find a walk through the city that would cross each bridge once and only once — a problem that Leonhard Euler proved to be unsolvable in 1736.

# Implications and Insights
Our exploration reveals important insights into the nature of graph theory and the complexities of network traversal:

# Eulerian Paths and Circuits: Our problem is essentially about finding an Eulerian path or circuit in a graph. An Eulerian path traverses every edge of a graph exactly once, while an Eulerian circuit starts and ends at the same vertex. Euler proved that such a path or circuit exists if and only if certain conditions are met, typically related to the degrees of the vertices.

# Graph Theory in Real-World Applications: While our specific bridge-crossing problem does not have a feasible solution, the underlying principles of graph theory are widely applicable in various fields, from logistics and transportation to computer science and network design.

# Limits of Combinatorial Approaches: Our tool exhaustively computed all possible walks, demonstrating the limitations when faced with certain constraints, like non-repeatable paths across edges in a graph.

# Final Thoughts
While our Bridge Walks Calculator did not yield a solution for crossing every bridge exactly once without repetition, it has successfully demonstrated a fundamental principle in graph theory and highlighted the intricacies involved in solving such combinatorial problems. This endeavor not only serves as an educational tool for understanding graph traversal problems but also reminds us of the rich history and ongoing relevance of mathematical explorations in understanding complex networks.
